      DARIAH Theme project: Contemporary collecting and COVID-19: barriers, bottlenecks, and perspectives in digital curation</h2>

          <h3>Seminar series:</br>Contemporary Collecting and COVID-19</h3>
            <div>
                <p>In 2020, institutions worldwide have started to collect witnesses and memories of the COVID-19 pandemic. A broad range of artefacts (or their digital images), written and oral accounts, digital documents and social media content, etc. have been collected by museums, libraries, web archives, and researchers. The peculiar nature of these contemporary collections, which are often assemblages of physical artefacts and born-digital material, poses many challenges in relation to the methods of collection and accession in cultural heritage organisations, participation and engagement in the formation of these collections, the cataloguing and curation of this heterogenous and abundant data, the standards needed for their digital preservation, their interpretation, the legal and ethical challenges connected to this material (ownership; copyright; data protection; code of ethics).</p>
                <p>This series of events aims to bring together practitioners and researchers in the heritage sector and in digital preservation to explore these collections of the pandemic, and the practices activated to collect, preserve, curate, and interpret this material. We envision four interdisciplinary events, in which to discuss perspectives and solutions for the collection</p>
